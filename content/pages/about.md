I create critical and informative content mostly about the politics of the Korean Peninsula. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Asian Studies from the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington Univeristy and I am currently a candidate for a Master of Arts in Korean Studies at the Seoul National University Graduate School of International Studies.

My mission is to help resolve the conflict on the Korean Peninsula by empowering the struggle against the violent presence and toxic influence of the United States.

In my spare time I enjoy [taking photos](https://photo.leeslaven.net), riding my fixed-gear, playing soccer, owning noobs, posting, and building solidarity.
