From threats of “fire and fury” to an amicable summit, 2018 was a monumental year for the North Korea-United States relationship. While the Singapore Summit did not by any means mark a fundamental change in the relationship, it did significantly alter the paradigm of diplomacy between the two countries for the better. 2019, on the other hand, has so far been much less promising, and the momentum towards peace between the two warring states has essentially stalled out. This freeze—or regression, even—can be attributed to John Bolton’s sinister [derailment of the summit in Hanoi][1], continuation and resumption of [US-ROK joint military exercises][2], and failure of the Trump administration to make any substantial steps towards the “peace regime” as agreed upon in Singapore.

This is probably as far as significant diplomacy between North Korea and the United States will go until President Trump is, hopefully, voted out of office. Although, the election of just any Democrat currently in the race does not necessarily mean the peace process with North Korea will resume. In fact, most of the candidates intend to make relations cold and hostile again. Several of the frontrunners such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have [denounced Trump’s engagement][3] and vowed to [revert the US diplomatic stance][4]. A liberal return to “normalcy” will resume the strategy that created the increasingly dangerous circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.

It is imperative the next US president (1) builds upon the minor progress made by President Trump and abides by the [Joint Declaration][5] he and Chairman Kim signed, (2) empowers the two Korean leaders responsible for beginning this whole process and making significant moves toward peace, and (3) works to actually fundamentally change the North Korea-United States relationship by, at the very least, establishing formal diplomatic relations and ending the Korean War.

The US media response to the first summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim was depraved, to say the least. The reaction from liberal media corporations was especially abhorrent—perhaps the most harebrained and vile coming from the most decorated liberal propagandist and conspiracy theorist, Rachel Maddow, who spun peace as being [bad because North Korea borders Russia][6]. The liberal media’s coverage of the historical meeting represents the Democratic establishment that is committed to supporting US interests across the world which requires upholding the boogeyman status of certain states (see Axis of Evil) in the mainstream American conscious. Most Americans are already trained to react with horror to a change in the status quo of US foreign policy, but particularly in the Trump era, liberals are even more eager to disapprove of anything the oaf in the White House does that does not meet their vague qualifications of being “presidential.” This so-called “Resistance” willingly supports President Trump and his attempted [coup in Venezuela][7], but when it comes to negotiating with the leader of a country the US is still at war with, somehow [“the world is losing”][8]. Of course, the foreign policy of this administration is overall horrendous, but the long-overdue dialogue with North Korea is undeniably positive. Meanwhile in South Korea, the sight of a US president making an effort to establish peace was overwhelmingly well-received. It was deeply disappointing, though not unexpected, to see the American “left-wing” mainstream media align with South Korea’s far-right media outlets.

These reactions were, however, totally unwarranted given that the summit meetings did not actually fundamentally change the relationship between North Korea and the United States. Shaking hands and smiling is an important first step in bringing about peace, but unless the United States follows through on its commitments and shows reciprocity in the deescalation of tensions, the friendliness is meaningless. The 2019 Hanoi Summit failed for this reason. The Trump administration is far too hawkish to actually do what is necessary to establish peace, which is why it is incredibly unlikely that the process will resume until the right person takes office in 2021.

As the Democratic primary race unfolds, the candidates’ approaches toward North Korea must be closely examined. The next president must be willing to resume the peace process and work with President Moon and Chairman Kim, who together deserve the credit for this relatively peaceful period. Considering the United States is the aggressor in this conflict, resolution requires making real, fundamental changes to the DPRK-US relationship. This must begin with the establishing official diplomatic relations, the signing a peace treaty, and reciprocation of commitments to denuclearization.
